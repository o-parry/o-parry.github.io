Hi, I'm Owain Parry, a Research Associate at the [School of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs). I completed my PhD in 2023 with a thesis titled *Understanding and Mitigating Flaky Software Test Cases*, supervised by [Phil McMinn](https://mcminn.info/). I currently work on the EPSRC-funded project [Test FLARE](https://test-flare.github.io/) (Test Flakiness Automated Reproduction and Explanation), focusing on the automated analysis and reproducibility of flaky tests. My broader research interests include quantum computing, with a particular focus on quantum software engineering, developed through my involvement with the [RoaRQ](https://www.roarq.cs.ox.ac.uk/) (Robust and Reliable Quantum Computing) project.
